# Predict_Customer_Segmentation
A model for predicting customer segmentation using K-Means Clustering and Support Vector Machine Classification:
1. Utilize the K-means clustering algorithm to classify customers into distinct clusters.
2. Employ the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification algorithm to determine the appropriate segment for each new customer.
